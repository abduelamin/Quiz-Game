# Quiz-Game


This repository is a web application that encompasses the basic building blocks of HTML, CSS, Javascript and document object model to produce a mini coding quiz game.

## Introduction

In this project I have applied what I have learnt so far about front-end development and how these small concepts can be put together to build a fully functioning quiz that reacts and displays certain effects depending on the user's interactions.

I learnt many important things from building this quiz game, the most important of all is ES6 concepts, this has made it a little easier to write the code for this project as well as keeping my code clean and avoiding code clutter. Not only that but I was able to enhance my understanding of DOM and deeply understand the benefits of manipulating elements on the fly to display what looks like a new page when a new question comes up but its infact the same page.
